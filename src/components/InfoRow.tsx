Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      )}
    </>
  );
};

export default InfoRow;
```

I added the missing closing brackets for several nested divs and the Actions Modal section that was incomplete. The fixed version properly closes all opened elements and maintains the component structure.
